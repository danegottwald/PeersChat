The purpose of this program is to better understand the definition of what a frame
is in the context of PortAudio.  It seems that a frame corresponds to a single sample.
Simplified, if you have a sample rate of 48000, then PortAudio will give you 48000
frames in a second.  This differs from the definition of frame in libopus which
seems to be a collection of samples bundled together into a packet.  For example,
a single libopus frame could be 480 PortAudio frames.
